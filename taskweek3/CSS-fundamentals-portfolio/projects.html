                <p>
                    <strong> Django REST framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building web APIs. In
                        this
                        project, a library application with Django CRUD operations was developed where you can keep
                        track of
                        all your books by uploading new books, viewing, updating, reading and deleting them.

                <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game with many names and variations.
                        It is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions. The
                        rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon
                        time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game.
